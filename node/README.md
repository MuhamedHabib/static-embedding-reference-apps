# Node application
This Node application demonstrates a Metabase dashboard embedded in a web application.

# Prerequisites
You should have already completed the setup on the README for this repository, which shows you how to get an instance of Metabase up and running in the [/metabase](../metabase) directory of this repository.

# Set up Node application
1. In a new terminal session, `cd` into this directory. 
2. Run `yarn install` to install the applications dependencies.
3. Run `node index.js`. The output should direct you to open your browser to localhost:3001.
