# Node application

This Node application demonstrates a Metabase dashboard embedded in a web application.

## Prerequisites

- You should have already completed the setup on the README for this repository, which shows you how to get an instance of Metabase up and running in the [/metabase](../metabase) directory of this repository.
- [Yarn package manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/).
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Set up Node application

1. In a new terminal session, `cd` into this directory. 

2. Run `yarn install` to install the application's dependencies.

3. Run `node index.js`. The output should direct you to open your browser to localhost:3001.

Explore the app to learn more about embedding Metabase charts and dashboards in applications. You can also check out the links to other documentation in our the main [README](../README.md).
