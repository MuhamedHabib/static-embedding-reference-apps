# Node application
This Node application demonstrates a Metabase dashboard embedded in a web application.

# Prerequisites
You should have already completed the setup on the README for this repository, which shows you how to get an instance of Metabase up and running in the /embedding-reference-apps/metabase/ folder of this repository.

# Set up Node application
1. In a new terminal session, `cd` into the node directory.
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Run `node index.js`. The output should direct you to open your browser to localhost:3000.
